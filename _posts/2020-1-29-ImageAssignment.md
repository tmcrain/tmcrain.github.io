This is my post for ATCM 2301.501.

![Image of a drawn dog wearing sunglasses and looking cool.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521829428314112000/630933578104176691/IMG_20191007_170935_321.jpg)

I like this image! A friend of mine drew it for Inktober 2019, and, wow! Look at that dog, they're so cool! I especially like the pencil marks below the finished piece- so authentic, and not at all a sign that my friend didn't have an eraser on her.
